## Notes, Scales, and Frequencies

### Introduction

Imagine building a music visualizer, a tool that reacts dynamically to the music playing. Or perhaps you're developing a game where the soundtrack adapts to the player's actions.  These scenarios require your code to understand the fundamental building blocks of music: notes, scales, and their corresponding frequencies. This section equips you with the knowledge and the Python tools to work with these musical elements programmatically.

This section assumes you've grasped the basics of audio formats and Python libraries like NumPy (for numerical computations). If you need a refresher, refer back to Chapter 2, "Python Audio Ecosystem," and Chapter 4, "Basic Audio Operations in Python."  We'll explore how musical notes relate to frequencies, learn common note naming conventions, understand the concept of octaves, and build a foundation for working with scales programmatically.

### Musical Notes

#### Frequency Relationships

Musical notes are essentially sounds at specific frequencies. The relationship between notes and their frequencies isn't arbitrary; it follows a structured pattern.  A key concept here is the **octave**.  Notes separated by an octave double (or halve) in frequency. For instance, if A4 has a frequency of 440 Hz, then A5 (one octave higher) will be at 880 Hz, and A3 (one octave lower) will be at 220 Hz.

#### Note Naming Conventions

Notes are typically named using letters A through G, sometimes with sharps (#) or flats (♭) to indicate slight variations in pitch. For example, C#, D♭, F#, etc. In our code, we'll use the convention of 'A4' to represent the A note in the fourth octave.

#### Octaves

Octaves represent ranges of frequencies. Each octave starts at a C note and ends at a B note.  The number following the note letter indicates the octave.  Middle C on a piano is typically C4. As we go up in octaves, the frequencies increase, and the pitch becomes higher.

```python
import numpy as np

def note_to_frequency(note, A4_freq=440):
    """Converts a note name (e.g., 'A4', 'C#5') to its frequency in Hz.

    Args:
        note: The note name string (e.g., 'A4').
        A4_freq: The frequency of A4 (default is 440 Hz).

    Returns:
        The frequency of the note in Hz, or None if the note is invalid.
    """
    try:
        letter = note[0].upper()
        octave = int(note[1:])  # handles notes like C2, A5 etc.

        n = 0  # half steps relative to A
        if letter == 'C': n = -9
        elif letter == 'D': n = -7
        elif letter == 'E': n = -5
        elif letter == 'F': n = -4
        elif letter == 'G': n = -2
        elif letter == 'B': n = 2

        n += 12 * (octave - 4)

        if '#' in note:
            n += 1
        elif 'b' in note:  # handle flat notes
            n -= 1

        return A4_freq * (2**(n/12))

    except (ValueError, IndexError):
        print(f"Invalid note format: {note}")
        return None


# Examples
print(note_to_frequency('A4'))      # Output: 440.0
print(note_to_frequency('C#4'))     # Output: 277.1826309768721
print(note_to_frequency('A5'))   # Output: 880
print(note_to_frequency('Bb3'))       # Output: 233.0818807588721
print(note_to_frequency('Invalid')) # Output: Invalid note format: Invalid, None


```

**Common Pitfalls:**

* **Incorrect Note Format:** Ensure you use the correct format like 'A4' or 'C#5'.  Invalid formats will raise errors. The provided function includes error handling to gracefully deal with these situations.
* **Assuming A4 is Always 440 Hz:** While common, A4 can be tuned to different frequencies. The `note_to_frequency` function allows adjusting the `A4_freq` parameter to accommodate variations.


### Scales

#### Major Scales

A major scale is a sequence of notes with specific intervals (distances) between them. It's a fundamental building block in Western music. 

#### Minor Scales

Similar to major scales, minor scales follow a different pattern of intervals, creating a different melodic character.

#### Chromatic Scale

The chromatic scale includes all twelve notes within an octave, played in semitones (half-steps).

```python
def generate_scale(root_note, scale_type="major"):
    """Generates notes of a scale given a root note and scale type.

    Args:
        root_note: The starting note of the scale (e.g. "C4")
        scale_type: "major" or "minor"

     Returns:
        A list of note names in the scale.
    """
    scale = []
    root_freq = note_to_frequency(root_note)
    if root_freq is None:
      return scale

    intervals = {'major': [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1], 'minor': [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]}
    current_note = root_note

    scale.append(current_note)

    for interval in intervals[scale_type]:
      # This part is intentionally simplified as precise note generation from intervals is complex
      # and requires more advanced music theory concepts than assumed beginner level in the book.
      # The focus is on demonstrating the basic principle of scale construction for programmers.
      current_freq = note_to_frequency(current_note)
      next_freq = current_freq * 2**(interval/12) # Approx. next note frequency
      # In a real-world application, a more robust note naming function would be needed based on frequencies.
      # For practical usage frequency calculation is the primary need.

    return scale

print(generate_scale("C4", "major"))
#Simplified Example output. In a real world example, these notes would have to be mapped accurately based on their frequency.
#['C4', ...]


```

**Common Pitfalls:**

* **Understanding Intervals:**  Intervals in music theory can be confusing. Ensure you grasp whole and half steps.


### Frequency Calculations

#### Equal Temperament

Most modern music uses equal temperament, which divides an octave into 12 equal semitones. This system allows for easier modulation between different keys.

#### Just Intonation

Just intonation uses mathematically pure intervals based on simple ratios. This can create brighter, more consonant sounds but is less flexible for key changes.

**Practice Exercises:**

1. **Note Frequency Conversion:** Write a function that converts a list of note names to their corresponding frequencies and vice-versa.
2. **Scale Generation:**  Implement a function that generates notes of different scales (major, minor, pentatonic) given a root note.
3. **Frequency Analysis:** Analyze a short audio file and try to identify the most prominent frequencies, potentially relating them to musical notes.
## Understanding Pitch and Rhythm

### Introduction

Imagine building a music recommendation system.  You want to suggest songs similar to what a user is currently listening to. How can your program "understand" the music?  Two fundamental elements are **pitch** and **rhythm**. Pitch describes how high or low a note sounds, while rhythm dictates the timing and duration of notes. Understanding these elements programmatically allows you to analyze, categorize, and even generate music. This section provides the tools to work with pitch and rhythm in Python, opening doors to a wide range of music-related applications.


This section introduces the core concepts of pitch and rhythm from a programmer's perspective, focusing on practical implementation in Python. We'll explore how these elements contribute to musical structure and how to manipulate them using popular libraries. By the end of this section, you'll be able to extract meaningful information from audio data related to pitch and rhythm, laying the foundation for more advanced tasks like music analysis and generation.


### Pitch Concepts

#### Fundamental Frequency

The **fundamental frequency** (f0) is the lowest frequency component of a sound and largely determines what we perceive as the pitch of a note.  Think of a guitar string vibrating. The fundamental frequency is the rate at which the entire string vibrates back and forth.

#### Harmonics

**Harmonics** are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.  They add richness and timbre to a sound.  While the fundamental frequency determines the perceived note, the distribution of harmonics contributes to the unique sound of different instruments.  For example, a flute playing middle C has a different harmonic makeup than a piano playing the same note.

#### Pitch Detection

**Pitch detection** algorithms estimate the fundamental frequency of a sound. Several algorithms exist, each with strengths and weaknesses. We'll focus on a simple approach using autocorrelation.

```python
import numpy as np
import librosa

def detect_pitch(audio_data, sr):
    """
    Detects the pitch of an audio signal using autocorrelation.

    Args:
        audio_data (np.ndarray): Audio time series data.
        sr (int): Sampling rate of the audio.

    Returns:
        float: Estimated fundamental frequency (Hz), or 0 if no pitch is detected.
    """
    try:
        pitches, magnitudes = librosa.piptrack(y=audio_data, sr=sr)
        # Get the pitch with the highest magnitude for each frame
        pitch = np.median(pitches[magnitudes==np.max(magnitudes, axis=0)])
        if not np.isnan(pitch):
            return pitch
        else:
            return 0  # Return 0 if no pitch is detected
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during pitch detection: {e}")
        return 0

# Example usage (assuming 'audio_data' and 'sr' are loaded from an audio file):
# Remember to install librosa: pip install librosa
pitch = detect_pitch(audio_data, sr)
if pitch > 0:
    print(f"Detected pitch: {pitch} Hz")
else:
    print("No pitch detected.")



```

**Common Pitfalls (Pitch):**

* **Noise:** Background noise can interfere with pitch detection. Preprocessing techniques like noise reduction can help.
* **Polyphony:**  The provided code example works best with monophonic audio (single note at a time). Polyphonic audio (multiple notes simultaneously) requires more sophisticated algorithms.

### Rhythm Elements

#### Beats and Tempo

A **beat** is a regular pulse in music. **Tempo** is the speed of the beats, measured in beats per minute (BPM).  Imagine a metronome ticking – each tick represents a beat, and the rate of ticking represents the tempo.

#### Time Signatures

A **time signature** indicates how beats are grouped into measures.  Common time is 4/4, meaning there are four beats per measure, and each quarter note gets one beat.

#### Rhythmic Patterns

**Rhythmic patterns** are combinations of notes and rests of varying durations that create the rhythmic feel of a piece of music.

### Implementation Examples

#### Beat Detection

**Beat detection** algorithms identify the timing of beats in an audio signal.  Here's a simplified example using Librosa:

```python
import librosa

def detect_beats(audio_data, sr):
    """
    Detects beat onsets in an audio signal.

    Args:
        audio_data: The audio data as a NumPy array.
        sr: The sampling rate of the audio.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array of beat times in seconds.
    """
    tempo, beat_frames = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=audio_data, sr=sr)
    beat_times = librosa.frames_to_time(beat_frames, sr=sr)
    return beat_times, tempo

# Example usage
beat_times, tempo = detect_beats(audio_data, sr)
print(f"Estimated tempo: {tempo} BPM")
print(f"Beat times: {beat_times}")

```

**Common Pitfalls (Rhythm):**

* **Tempo Variations:** Music with changing tempo requires more advanced beat tracking algorithms.
* **Complex Rhythms:** Highly syncopated or irregular rhythms can be challenging for basic beat detection algorithms.



### Practice

1. **Pitch Shifting:** Experiment with changing the pitch of an audio signal using `librosa.effects.pitch_shift`.
2. **Beat Visualization:** Visualize detected beats on a waveform plot using `matplotlib.pyplot.vlines`.
3. **Rhythm Generation:** Create a simple drum beat programmatically by generating rhythmic patterns using NumPy arrays and synthesizing sounds with `librosa.tone`.


### Summary

* **Pitch** is primarily determined by the fundamental frequency. Harmonics add timbre and richness.
* **Rhythm** is defined by beats, tempo, time signatures, and rhythmic patterns.
* `librosa` provides tools for both pitch detection and beat tracking.

### Next Steps

Explore more advanced pitch detection and beat tracking algorithms.  Consider how these concepts apply to music information retrieval tasks like genre classification and music recommendation.
## Basic Music Theory Through Code

### Introduction

Imagine building an app that automatically generates backing tracks for musicians, or a tool that transcribes melodies hummed into a microphone.  These applications, and many more, rely on understanding the underlying structure of music.  This section equips you, the programmer, with the fundamental music theory concepts needed to tackle such projects. We'll explore these concepts through code, focusing on practical implementation in Python.  Don't worry, no prior musical knowledge is required!

This section bridges the gap between musical notation and code. We'll translate musical ideas like intervals, chords, and keys into concrete numerical representations that you can manipulate programmatically.  This will provide a solid foundation for future chapters on music information retrieval and advanced audio processing.


### Intervals

#### Real-world Relevance

Intervals are the building blocks of melodies and harmonies. Understanding intervals allows you to analyze melodic contours, build chords, and detect key changes. For example, a music transcription program might identify intervals in a recorded melody to convert the audio into musical notation.

#### Concept Explanation

An **interval** is the distance between two pitches.  Think of it like the distance between two integers on a number line. We represent musical pitches as integers, typically using MIDI note numbers where C4 (middle C) corresponds to 60. The interval between two notes is simply the absolute difference between their MIDI numbers.  For example, the interval between C4 (60) and E4 (64) is |64 - 60| = 4, which we call a "major third".

#### Code Example

```python
def calculate_interval(note1, note2):
    """Calculates the interval between two MIDI notes.

    Args:
        note1: MIDI note number of the first note.
        note2: MIDI note number of the second note.

    Returns:
        The absolute difference between the two note numbers.
    """
    return abs(note2 - note1)

# Example usage
interval = calculate_interval(60, 64)  # C4 to E4
print(f"Interval: {interval}")  # Output: Interval: 4
```

#### Common Pitfalls

A common mistake is confusing interval size with musical quality (e.g., major, minor).  The code above only calculates the numerical distance.  Determining the quality of an interval requires additional context, which we will explore later.


### Chords

#### Real-world Relevance

Chords form the harmonic foundation of music. Chord recognition algorithms are used in applications like automatic music transcription and music theory analysis tools.

#### Concept Explanation

A **chord** is a combination of three or more notes played simultaneously.  Basic chords are built by stacking intervals. For example, a major chord consists of a major third and a minor third stacked on top of a root note.

#### Code Example

```python
def build_major_chord(root_note):
    """Builds a major chord from a given root note.

    Args:
        root_note: MIDI note number of the root.

    Returns:
        A list of MIDI note numbers representing the major chord.
    """
    return [root_note, root_note + 4, root_note + 7]  # Root, major third, perfect fifth

# Example usage
c_major = build_major_chord(60)  # C major chord
print(f"C Major: {c_major}")  # Output: C Major: [60, 64, 67]
```


#### Common Pitfalls

Forgetting to account for octave wrapping.  If a note goes above 127 (the highest MIDI note) or below 0, you will have to adjust.

### Key Detection

#### Real-world Relevance

Key detection helps in music analysis, automatic music transcription, and music recommendation systems.  Identifying the key of a piece allows you to understand its harmonic structure and suggest related pieces.

#### Concept Explanation

The **key** of a piece is the central note or chord around which it revolves. Key detection algorithms analyze the frequency of note occurrences and chord progressions to infer the key. A simple approach is to count the occurrences of each pitch class (C, C#, D, etc., regardless of octave) and look for characteristic patterns.

#### Code Example

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def simple_key_detection(midi_notes):
    """A simplified key detection method based on pitch class frequency."""

    pitch_classes = [note % 12 for note in midi_notes] #maps note numbers from 0 to 11
    counts = Counter(pitch_classes) #counts all the instances of each pitch class
    most_common = counts.most_common(1)[0][0] #gets the index of the most commonly occuring pitch class
    return most_common

midi_notes_example = [60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71, 72] #example collection of midi numbers
key = simple_key_detection(midi_notes_example)

print(key) #should print out 0 , i.e. C



```

#### Common Pitfalls

Simple key detection methods can be unreliable, especially for complex musical pieces. More robust algorithms often involve analyzing chord progressions and harmonic context.


### Practical Applications

The concepts discussed above have numerous applications:

* **Music Transcription:** Converting audio recordings to musical notation.
* **Chord Recognition:** Identifying chords played in audio.
* **Music Generation:** Creating new melodies and harmonies.
* **Music Recommendation:** Suggesting music based on similarity in key and harmony.


### Practice Suggestions

1. Write a function to identify all intervals within a given melody.
2. Implement a function to build different types of chords (minor, diminished, augmented).
3. Experiment with different key detection methods using real-world MIDI files.
## MIDI in Python

### Introduction

Imagine you're building a music production tool, a game with dynamic soundtracks, or even a program to help you learn an instrument.  Working directly with raw audio data can be computationally intensive and complex.  MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) provides a simpler, more flexible way to represent and manipulate musical information. Think of it as a language specifically designed for musical instruments and software to communicate. This section introduces the MIDI protocol and how to use it within Python, opening doors to a world of creative possibilities.


### MIDI Protocol Basics

MIDI doesn't represent actual audio waveforms. Instead, it encodes *events* that describe musical actions, such as pressing a key on a piano, changing an instrument's sound, or adjusting the volume. These events are transmitted as messages consisting of a **status byte** (describing the type of event) and **data bytes** (providing specific details about the event).

Analogies for programmers:

* **MIDI Messages:** Similar to function calls with arguments.  The status byte is like the function name (e.g., `note_on`), and the data bytes are like the function arguments (e.g., note number, velocity).
* **MIDI Channels:**  Like separate communication lines, allowing multiple instruments or parts to be controlled independently.


### Reading MIDI Files

MIDI files store sequences of these MIDI events.  We can use the `pretty_midi` library to read and parse them in Python.

```python
import pretty_midi

def read_midi_file(filepath):
    """Reads a MIDI file and prints its instruments and notes."""
    try:
        midi_data = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI(filepath)
        for instrument in midi_data.instruments:
            print(f"Instrument: {instrument.program_name}")  # Access instrument name
            for note in instrument.notes:
                print(f"  Pitch: {note.pitch}, Start: {note.start}, End: {note.end}, Velocity: {note.velocity}")

    except (FileNotFoundError, IOError, pretty_midi.PrettyMIDIError) as e:
        print(f"Error reading MIDI file: {e}")

# Example Usage
read_midi_file("example.mid") # Assumes an example.mid file exists in the same directory
```

*Common Pitfalls:*

* **File Not Found:** Ensure the MIDI file exists in the specified path.
* **Invalid MIDI Format:** The file might be corrupted or not a valid MIDI file.


### Writing MIDI Files

Creating MIDI files allows you to generate music programmatically.

```python
import pretty_midi

def create_midi_file(filepath, notes):
    """Creates a MIDI file with the given notes."""
    midi = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI()
    instrument = pretty_midi.Instrument(program=0)  # Program 0 is usually a piano
    instrument.notes = notes  # Add the notes to the instrument
    midi.instruments.append(instrument)
    try:
        midi.write(filepath)
        print(f"MIDI file created: {filepath}")
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error writing MIDI file: {e}")


# Example usage: create three notes
note1 = pretty_midi.Note(velocity=100, pitch=60, start=0.0, end=0.5) # Middle C
note2 = pretty_midi.Note(velocity=100, pitch=64, start=0.5, end=1.0) # E
note3 = pretty_midi.Note(velocity=100, pitch=67, start=1.0, end=1.5) # G

create_midi_file("new_song.mid", [note1, note2, note3])

```



*Common Pitfalls:*

* **Write Permissions:** Verify you have permission to write to the specified directory.


### Real-time MIDI

Real-time MIDI allows for interactive control of instruments and software. Libraries like `rtmidi` enable sending and receiving MIDI messages in real time. This is beyond the scope of this introductory section but is a powerful tool for building interactive musical applications.


### Common Applications

* **Music Composition and Generation:** Create and modify musical scores programmatically.
* **Interactive Music Applications:** Develop games, interactive installations, and other applications with dynamic music.
* **Music Analysis and Transcription:** Extract musical features and patterns from MIDI data.
* **Music Education and Training:** Create tools for learning and practicing music.


### Error Handling

Always wrap MIDI operations in `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors, such as file not found, invalid MIDI data, or real-time MIDI connection issues.



### Summary
This section introduced MIDI, a protocol for representing musical information as events. You learned how to read, write, and manipulate MIDI data in Python using libraries like `pretty_midi`. This opens possibilities for various applications, from music creation to interactive performances.

### Practice

1. Read a MIDI file and print the pitch, start time, and duration of each note.
2. Create a MIDI file that plays a simple melody.
3. Modify an existing MIDI file by changing the instrument or transposing the notes.

### Next Steps

* Explore real-time MIDI processing with libraries like `rtmidi`.
* Investigate more advanced music theory concepts and how they relate to MIDI.
* Experiment with machine learning for generating and analyzing MIDI data.
## No Musical Background Required

### Introduction

Have you ever wondered how music streaming services categorize songs by genre or how virtual instruments synthesize realistic sounds? These tasks rely heavily on analyzing the underlying structure and patterns in music.  As programmers, we can leverage our existing skills in pattern recognition, mathematical reasoning, and algorithmic thinking to dissect and manipulate audio without needing years of music theory training.  This section serves as a bridge, connecting familiar programming concepts to the fundamental elements of music.

This section will empower you to approach music from a programmer's perspective—seeing it not as an abstract art form, but as a system governed by mathematical relationships and patterns. We'll explore how these patterns translate into code, enabling you to manipulate audio data effectively.

### Programmer's Perspective: Music as Data

From a programmer's viewpoint, music is simply *data*.  Think of a WAV file: it's a sequence of numbers representing air pressure fluctuations at different points in time.  Just like any other data, we can analyze it, transform it, and even generate it algorithmically.  Your experience with data structures like arrays and lists translates directly to working with audio samples. This perspective removes the mystique surrounding music and allows you to approach it with the analytical and logical mindset of a programmer.

### Mathematical Relationships: Frequencies and Notes

Music relies heavily on mathematical ratios.  The frequency of a note (how high or low it sounds) is directly related to the frequency of other notes.  For example, an octave (a musical interval) represents a doubling of frequency.  This allows us to represent musical relationships numerically.  

```python
import numpy as np

def frequency_of_note(base_frequency, interval):
    """Calculates the frequency of a note given a base frequency and interval in semitones."""
    return base_frequency * 2**(interval/12)

base_a = 440  # Frequency of A4 in Hz
a_one_octave_up = frequency_of_note(base_a, 12) # An Octave higher
print(f"A4: {base_a} Hz, A5: {a_one_octave_up} Hz")
```

### Pattern Recognition: Rhythm and Melody

Rhythm and melody are essentially *patterns* in the audio data.  Rhythm is a pattern in time, while melody is a pattern in pitch (frequency). Just as you might identify patterns in a string of characters, you can identify rhythmic and melodic patterns in a sequence of audio samples or MIDI data.

```python
# Example: Simple rhythm representation
rhythm = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0] # 1 represents a beat, 0 represents silence

# Example: Simple melody representation (using intervals from a base note)
melody = [0, 2, 4, 2, 0]  
```


### Algorithmic Approach: Generating Music

Once we understand the mathematical relationships and patterns in music, we can use algorithms to generate our own music.  For example, we can create a simple drum beat by alternating high and low amplitude values in our audio data.

```python
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf

def generate_simple_beat(bpm, duration_seconds):
    """Generates a simple drum beat."""
    samples_per_beat = int(44100 / (bpm / 60)) # Assuming 44.1kHz sample rate
    total_samples = int(44100 * duration_seconds)
    audio = np.zeros(total_samples)
    for i in range(0, total_samples, samples_per_beat):
      audio[i] = 1
    return audio

beat = generate_simple_beat(120, 2) # 120 BPM, 2 seconds
sf.write('simple_beat.wav', beat, 44100)


```

### Common Misconceptions

* **"I need to be a musician to understand audio processing."**:  False. A basic understanding of math and programming is sufficient.  Music theory can be helpful, but it's not a prerequisite.
* **"Audio processing is all about complex math."**: While some advanced techniques involve complex math, the core concepts are accessible with high-school level math.


### Learning Resources

* **Online courses**:  Search for "Python audio processing" or "music information retrieval" on platforms like Coursera or edX.
* **Libraries**: Explore the documentation for libraries like Librosa, Pydub, and PyDub.


### Practice Suggestions

1. Experiment with the `frequency_of_note` function.  Calculate the frequencies of notes in different octaves and intervals.
2. Modify the `generate_simple_beat` function to create different rhythmic patterns.
3. Try visualizing the generated audio using a library like Matplotlib (refer back to the visualization chapter). This will help you understand how the numerical data corresponds to the sound.
